# random-walk-continents
A python script that uses matplotlib to plot the path of a randomly moving particle, generating continent-like structures in the process.


Instructions:

Using the .ipynb (Anaconda required for Jupyter/matplotlib):
1. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook (in folder containing the .ipynb type "jupyter notebook" into command line on Windows)
2. Run the file with Shift+Return. Push the "n" slider all the way to the right and you get to see the continent generated :)
3. Save image and customise to your heart's content in MS Paint or other program like paint.net (e.g. to remove lakes, make islands)

Using the .py (matplotlib required):
1. Open the .py file from the command line ("python random_walk.py" on Windows). The continent will appear (no slider :( )
2. Save and customise in MS Paint or other program like paint.net  (e.g. to remove lakes, make islands)

Note: Sometimes the continents are too thin or snaky to look like "real" continents. If this happens just run the program again until you get one that you like the look of.
